# tests_LISA_response
We want to compare different LISA response functions. In particular we want to compare the signals that are generated by different available softwares (e.g. LDC implementation of FastGB vs implementation of SyntheticLISA). Finally, we adapt the tri-linear approximation to each implementation and test its accuracy.
